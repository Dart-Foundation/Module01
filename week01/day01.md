Certainly! Here's a detailed breakdown of Day 1 of Week 1 in your Dart Foundation course, including assignments:

**Week 1: Course Introduction and Setup**

**Day 1: Course Introduction and Objectives**

**Lesson Objectives:**
- Introduce students to the Dart Foundation course.
- Set up the development environment for Dart programming.
- Write a simple "Hello, Dart!" program.

**Lesson Outline:**

**1. Introduction to the Dart Foundation Course (30 minutes)**

Hello students,

Welcome to the Dart Foundation course! Over the next 12 weeks, we will delve into the fundamentals of Dart programming, equipping you with the skills to build robust applications. Let's take a moment to outline our objectives for this course.

- Understand the core concepts of the Dart programming language.
- Develop problem-solving skills through practical coding exercises.
- Gain proficiency in writing efficient and clean Dart code.
- Prepare you for more advanced programming concepts in the second module.

**2. Setting Up the Development Environment (45 minutes)**

Now, let's ensure you have the necessary tools for this journey. We'll be using the Dart SDK and a code editor for our development. Here's what you need to do:

- Visit the official Dart SDK website (https://dart.dev/get-dart) and follow the instructions for your respective operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Once installed, open your preferred code editor. I recommend using Visual Studio Code, which provides excellent support for Dart development.

I'll be available to assist with any installation issues you may encounter.

**3. Writing and Running a "Hello, Dart!" Program (45 minutes)**

Let's dive right into coding! We'll start with a simple program that prints "Hello, Dart!" to the console.

Create a new Dart file named "hello_dart.dart" in your code editor. Then, type the following code:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
}
```

Save the file and execute it. You should see the output "Hello, Dart!" in your console.

**Practical Assignment (Homework):**

Your task for today is to ensure you have the Dart SDK installed and to successfully run the "Hello, Dart!" program. Here are the steps:

1. Install the Dart SDK if you haven't already.
2. Create a new Dart file named "hello_dart.dart" in your code editor.
3. Write the provided code and save the file.
4. Execute the program and take a screenshot of the output.

Submit your screenshot through the course's preferred communication platform (e.g., email or our learning management system) by the end of the day.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any difficulties. Good luck, and let's embark on this exciting learning journey together!
