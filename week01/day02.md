**Week 1: Course Introduction and Setup**

**Day 2: Dart Language Overview**

**Lesson Objectives:**
- Provide a comprehensive overview of the Dart programming language.
- Understand the basic structure of Dart programs and code organization.

**Lesson Outline:**

**1. Review of Previous Day (15 minutes)**

- Begin the lesson by briefly recapping what was covered on Day 1, including setting up the development environment and running the "Hello, Dart!" program.
- Address any questions or issues that students may have encountered during the setup process.

**2. Introduction to Dart (30 minutes)**

- Start by explaining what Dart is and its significance in modern programming.
- Discuss the origins of Dart, its key features, and its applications, including web and mobile development.

**3. Dart Program Structure (45 minutes)**

- Dive into the structure of a Dart program, covering topics such as:
  - The `main()` function as the entry point.
  - Statements and expressions in Dart.
  - Comments (single-line and multi-line) for code documentation.

**4. Code Organization and Best Practices (30 minutes)**

- Emphasize the importance of clean and organized code.
- Discuss naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Introduce code indentation and formatting guidelines.

**Practical Assignment (Homework):**

For today's assignment, you will practice writing well-structured Dart code.

**Assignment 1: Code Organization (Due Tomorrow)**

1. Create a new Dart file in your code editor and name it "dart_structure.dart."

2. In this file, write a Dart program that:
   - Declares at least two variables with appropriate names.
   - Uses the `main()` function as the entry point.
   - Contains comments that explain the purpose of your code.

3. Apply proper code formatting and indentation following the best practices discussed in class.

4. Save the file and make sure it's organized and easy to read.

**Assignment 2: Research and Write (Due in Two Days)**

1. Research one real-world application or project that uses the Dart programming language. It could be a web app, mobile app, or any other relevant use case.

2. Write a brief summary (150-200 words) of your findings. Include information about what the application does and why Dart was chosen for it. Also, mention any notable features or challenges faced in using Dart.

Submit Assignment 1 tomorrow, and Assignment 2 in two days through the course's preferred communication platform.
