Certainly! Here's a detailed breakdown of Day 3 of Week 1 in your Dart Foundation course, including assignments and example source code:

**Week 1: Course Introduction and Setup**

**Day 3: Basic Dart Syntax**

**Lesson Objectives:**
- Explore the basic syntax elements of the Dart programming language.
- Understand how to declare variables and work with data types.
- Practice writing simple Dart programs.

**Lesson Outline:**

**1. Review of Previous Days (15 minutes)**

- Begin by briefly reviewing the concepts covered on Day 1 (setting up the development environment) and Day 2 (Dart language overview and program structure).
- Address any questions or concerns from the students regarding the previous lessons.

**2. Basic Dart Syntax (45 minutes)**

- Introduce the concept of syntax in programming and its importance.
- Cover the following basic syntax elements in Dart:
  - Statements and expression terminators.
  - Variables and their declaration (var, final, const).
  - Data types (int, double, String, bool).
  - Type annotations and inference.

**Example Source Code:**

```dart
void main() {
  // Statements and expression terminators
  print('Hello, Dart!'); // This is a statement
  print('Welcome to Dart Programming.'); // Another statement

  // Variables and their declaration
  var age = 25; // Variable 'age' is declared and initialized with value 25
  final piValue = 3.14; // Final variable 'piValue' is declared and assigned a value (cannot be changed)
  const appName = 'My Dart App'; // Constant variable 'appName'

  // Data types
  String name = 'John Doe'; // String data type
  int quantity = 10; // Integer data type
  double price = 19.99; // Double data type
  bool isDartFun = true; // Boolean data type

  // Type annotations and inference
  var message = 'Welcome to Dart!'; // Dart infers the data type as String
  int numberOfStudents = 50; // Explicitly declaring the data type as int

  // Print variables to the console
  print('Age: $age');
  print('Pi Value: $piValue');
  print('App Name: $appName');
  print('Name: $name');
  print('Quantity: $quantity');
  print('Price: $price');
  print('Is Dart Fun?: $isDartFun');
  print('Message: $message');
  print('Number of Students: $numberOfStudents');
}
```

**3. Hands-On Coding (60 minutes)**

- Engage students in coding exercises to practice the syntax elements covered:
  - Declare and initialize variables of different data types.
  - Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Concatenate strings and work with booleans.

**Practical Assignment (Homework):**

For today's assignment, you will apply what you've learned about basic Dart syntax.

**Assignment: Simple Calculator (Due in Two Days)**

Your task is to create a simple Dart program that functions as a calculator. Here are the requirements:

1. Create a new Dart file in your code editor and name it "calculator.dart."

2. In this file, write a Dart program that:
   - Declares two variables to store numeric values (you can choose the data type).
   - Calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these two values.
   - Prints the results to the console in a clear and readable format.

3. Use comments to explain each part of your code.

4. Save the file and ensure it's well-organized and properly formatted.

5. Test your program with different values to verify its correctness.

Submit your "calculator.dart" file in two days through the course's preferred communication platform.

Remember to adhere to the basic syntax rules and principles discussed in class. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.

Happy coding!
